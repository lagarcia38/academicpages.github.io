Hi! I'm **Dr. Luis Antonio Garcia**. I just recently joined [USC Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/) as a Computer Research Scientist focusing on how we can provide any notions of safety and security for the learning-enabled Internet-of-Things (IoT)/Cyber-physical Systems (CPS). I previously held a postdoctoral appointment at the [Networked & Embedded Systems Laboratory](http://nesl.ucla.edu/) at the [UCLA ECE Department](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/), collaborating with [Dr. Mani Srivastava](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/mani-srivastava/). I have my PhD in Computer Engineering with a Cybersecurity focus from [Rutgers University](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/), where my research advisor was [Dr. Saman Zonouz](https://sites.google.com/site/samanzonouz4n6/). My [dissertation](https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/59094/) was titled "Physics for Sake of Security, Security for the Sake of Physics". Please don't confuse me with the other Dr. Luis Garcia from Rutgers that roamed the academic world of the 80's.

I was previously an academic intern at the [Logical Systems Lab](https://www.ls.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I collaborated with [Dr. André Platzer](http://symbolaris.com/) in 2017. We worked on the verification of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in the context of  I also interned as a Software Developer Intern at [Siemens Corporate Research](https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/siemens-in-the-usa/princeton.html) in 2015 working with Dr. Dong Wei on PLC security.


Research Interests
======
<img align="center" src="images/research-overview.PNG">
My current and future research interests reside in the alignment of a human’s semantic understanding of the world with a deep learning model’s semantic understanding of its environment in order to enable a deterministic relationship for providing mutual assurances in cyber-physical contexts. In particular, my research aims to answer the following three questions:
* **Integration of Human Logic & Deep Learning in Cyber-physical Contexts**. How can we design
neural-symbolic frameworks that are semantically conscious of their subsuming cyber-physical systems?
* **Programming Abstractions for Performant Cyber-physical Systems**. In distributed and heterogeneous IoT environments enabled with such neural-symbolic frameworks, what are the correct programming abstractions that need to be exposed to developers?
* **Safety, Security, and Privacy for Performant Cyber-physical Systems**. How can we defend against collateral safety, security, and privacy threats that will subsequently be exposed by semantically-aware, sensor-rich, adaptive, and distributed heterogeneous IoT environments?

Feel free to take a deep dive into a breakdown of my publications and research interests [here](publications).

If you’d like to work with me, I am currently not hiring student workers.  If you are a Ph.D. student or if you would like to potentially work with me under a directed research, please send me an email. I'm always open to collaboration.
